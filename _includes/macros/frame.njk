{# this container macro would utilize the src passed as well as utilize styles on the button #}

{# It is possible to open the content of an <iframe> in a new window or tab using JavaScript. While you cannot directly force the <iframe> itself to open in a new window, you can create a link or button that, when clicked, opens the <iframe>'s source URL in a new window.
Here's how you can achieve this: HTML Structure.
Code

    <iframe id="myIframe" src="your_iframe_content.html"></iframe>
    <button onclick="openIframeInNewWindow()">Open in New Window</button>
JavaScript Function.
JavaScript

    function openIframeInNewWindow() {
        var iframe = document.getElementById('myIframe');
        if (iframe && iframe.src) {
            window.open(iframe.src, '_blank');
        } else {
            console.error("Iframe not found or src attribute is missing.");
        }
    }
Explanation:
document.getElementById('myIframe'): This retrieves a reference to the <iframe> element using its ID.
iframe.src: This accesses the URL currently loaded in the <iframe>.
window.open(iframe.src, '_blank'): This is the core of the solution.
window.open() is a JavaScript method used to open a new browser window or tab.
iframe.src is the URL that will be loaded in the new window/tab.
'_blank' is a special target that instructs the browser to open the URL in a new, unnamed window or tab. The user's browser settings will determine whether it opens as a new tab or a new window.
This method effectively takes the URL from the <iframe> and uses it to open a new browsing context, providing the desired functionality. #}
